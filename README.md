This work is inspired and reproduced from John S Delaney's research article. In this project, a simple method for estimating the aqueous solubility (ESOL âˆ’ Estimated SOLubility) of a compound directly from its structure is described. 
The most significant parameter was calculated logPoctanol, followed by molecular weight, proportion of heavy atoms in aromatic systems, and number of rotatable bonds.
